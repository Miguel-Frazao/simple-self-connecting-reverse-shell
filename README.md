# Simple self connecting reverse shell
This is an example of a self connecting backdoor which provides a shell for the attacker

This code is prepared for a Linux based demonstration. And the server.py is supose to be executed with python3.x

Usage:
1. Just start the client.py program to see it trying to connect with the hacker.
2. Start the server in another terminal and gain control of client machine

Of course, in the real world scripts like this will never print anything...
